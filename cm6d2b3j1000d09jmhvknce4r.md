## A Flashback to Where It All Began üï∞Ô∏è

In March 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), came up with the idea of a system that would let scientists share information across different locations. His goal was to create a platform where researchers could easily communicate and collaborate using the internet by linking documents with hyperlinks.

By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee had built the first web browser and server on a NeXT computer at CERN. This was the birth of the World Wide Web. It allowed users to move from one document to another, which became known as "surfing the web." In 1993, CERN made the web a public standard, so anyone could use it freely, helping it grow rapidly.

## **The World Wide Web vs. The Internet** üåç

The **Internet** is a vast network connecting computers and devices all over the world, and it uses various **protocols** (rules or languages) to send and receive information. The **Web** (or World Wide Web), however, is just one service that runs on the internet, and it specifically uses the **HTTP** protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to display web pages in your browser. It is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and other resources that are accessed via the internet. So, while the internet is the infrastructure that connects everything and lets you do things like send emails or make video calls, the web is a part of it, using protocols like HTTP to let you access websites.

## **How Does the Web Work?** ‚ö°

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step overview of what happens when you visit a website:

1. **You Enter a URL**  
    You type a URL (e.g., www.google.com) into your browser.
    
2. **Browser Sends a Request**  
    The browser sends a request to a **Domain Name System (DNS)** to translate the website name into an IP address (a unique number for servers).
    
3. **Server Responds**  
    The web server sends back the requested files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    
4. **Browser Renders the Page**  
    Your browser processes these files and displays the webpage.
    

This process happens in seconds!

## **Layers of the Web: Surface, Deep, and Dark** üåä

The Web has layers‚Äîjust like an iceberg:

### Surface Web

The **Surface Web** is the part of the internet that everyone can access using search engines like Google. It includes websites like blogs, news sites, and online stores. It's the most familiar part of the web that you use daily. For example, when you search for something like ‚Äúhow to cook pasta,‚Äù the websites that pop up in your search results belong to the Surface Web. This is the web most of us use every day.

### Deep Web

The **Deep Web** is made up of parts of the internet that aren't indexed by search engines. These are private areas, like academic databases, private company intranets, or personal email inboxes. You can only access them with permission or special credentials. For example, when you log into your school‚Äôs private library database or access sensitive files stored in your cloud account, you are using the Deep Web.

### Dark Web

The **Dark Web** is a hidden part of the internet that requires special tools, like the Tor browser, to access. It is encrypted for privacy and often used for both legal and illegal activities. While it can be a space for privacy, it‚Äôs also associated with criminal activity. For example, journalists or activists in countries where freedom of speech is restricted may use the Dark Web to communicate safely and hide their identities from being watched.

## **Web Technologies You Should Know** üõ†Ô∏è

Here are some common terms you might encounter:

### **1\. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

TCP is a reliable way to send data across the internet. It breaks up data into small packets and ensures they arrive in the correct order.

* **How it works:** When you send data over TCP, each packet is numbered, and the receiver uses those numbers to put them back together in the right order. If a packet is lost or corrupted, the receiver asks for it to be sent again. This makes TCP perfect for things where you need all the data, like loading websites or sending emails.
    
* **Example:** When you're watching a video on **YouTube**, TCP makes sure all video data (like images and sound) arrives in the correct order, ensuring smooth playback.
    

---

### **2\. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

UDP is a faster but less reliable protocol than TCP. It doesn‚Äôt check if packets arrive in order or if they even arrive at all.

* **How it works:** UDP sends data without waiting for confirmation that it has been received or asking for packets to be re-sent. This makes it much faster but means some data might be lost along the way.
    
* **Example:** When you're using a **video chat app** like **Zoom**, UDP helps transmit your voice and video quickly. A tiny bit of packet loss (like a slight glitch) doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience, but delays or interruptions would.
    

---

### **3\. IP (Internet Protocol)**

IP is a protocol that gives unique addresses (IP addresses) to devices connected to the internet and helps route packets of data to their correct destination.

* **How it works:** Just like how a postal system uses addresses to send packages to the right location, the internet uses IP addresses to send data to the correct device. Every device has a unique IP address (like **192.168.0.1**), and this address is used to find it on the internet.
    
* **Example:** When you visit [**www.amazon.com**](http://www.amazon.com), your browser looks up Amazon‚Äôs IP address to connect to their web servers. The server then sends the correct data back to your computer using IP.
    

---

### **4\. Packet Switching**

Packet switching is how data is broken up into smaller chunks (packets) and sent across the network, often taking different routes to reach the destination.

* **How it works:** Instead of sending large chunks of data as one continuous stream, data is broken down into smaller packets. These packets travel across different routes in the network and are reassembled at the destination. This makes the internet more efficient and flexible, as different packets may take the fastest or least congested path.
    
* **Example:** When you send a message over **WhatsApp**, the message might travel across different routes to reach the recipient‚Äôs phone, depending on which route is fastest or least busy at the time.
    

---

### 5\. **Web Browsers**

A web browser, like Chrome or Firefox, lets you view websites by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* **Example:** When you open **Amazon**, your browser loads the webpage and shows you all the products available.
    

---

### 6\. **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

HTTP is a language used to request and send information between your browser and a website. HTTPS is a safer version that keeps your information private.

* **Example:** When you visit **PayPal**, HTTPS keeps your payment details safe.
    

---

### 7\. **Web Servers**

Web servers store website files and send them to your browser when you want to visit a website.

* **Example:** **Reddit** uses a web server to send the content (like posts and images) to your browser when you load the site.
    

---

### 8\. **Databases**

Databases store and organize lots of data for websites. They hold things like user profiles or posts.

* **Example:** **Facebook** uses a database to store your posts, photos, and friends.
    

---

### 9\. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**

APIs allow different websites or apps to talk to each other and share information.

* **Example:** When you sign into a site using your **Google** account, an API connects the website to your Google account to log you in.
    

---

### 10\. **Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing stores website data online, not on physical computers. It allows websites to be more flexible and scalable.

* **Example:** **Netflix** stores its movies in the cloud, so you can watch them from anywhere.
    

---

### 11\. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**

CDNs store copies of website content in different locations worldwide to speed up page loading times by delivering content from servers closest to the user.

* Example: [www.cloudflare.com](http://www.cloudflare.com) caches website data and serves it faster to users from different locations.
    

---

### 12\. **WebSockets**

WebSockets enable two-way communication between the web server and the browser, allowing real-time updates without refreshing the page.

* **Example:** In an online game like [**Chess.com**](http://Chess.com), WebSockets allow players to see each other‚Äôs moves instantly.
    

---

### 13\. **Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on your device to remember things like your login or preferences.

* **Example:** **Amazon** uses cookies to remember your shopping cart or login details.
    

---

### 14\. **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**

WebRTC allows video and voice calls directly from your browser without needing extra software.

* **Example:** **Zoom** uses WebRTC to make video calls without needing to install anything.
    

---

### 15\. **DNS (Domain Name System)**

DNS acts like the phonebook of the internet, translating website names into addresses computers can understand.

* **Example:** When you type [**www.netflix.com**](http://www.netflix.com), DNS helps find the correct server to load the website.
    

---

### 16\. **Single-Page Applications (SPA)**

SPAs load just one page and update the content dynamically, making websites feel faster.

* **Example:** **Twitter** is an SPA where new tweets appear without the page reloading.
    

---

### 17\. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**

SEO helps websites rank higher in search results, making them easier to find.

* **Example:** **BBC** uses SEO techniques to ensure its articles show up at the top of search results.

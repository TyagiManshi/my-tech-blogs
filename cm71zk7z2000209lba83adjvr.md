In today's digital world, secure communication is essential. Every time you browse a website, send an email, or make an online purchase, data travels across the internet using protocols that define how information is transmitted. Among the most critical are **HTTP and HTTPS**.

## **HTTP vs HTTPS**

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of web communication, allowing browsers and servers to exchange data. It facilitates the retrieval of linked resources, enabling users to navigate between web pages seamlessly. However, it lacks encryption, making data vulnerable to interception by hackers.

To mitigate these security concerns, **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** was introduced. HTTPS integrates HTTP with **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, formerly known as **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**, to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details, remains protected.

## SSL/TLS: The Pillars of Secure Web Communication

SSL and TLS are technologies that encrypt (secure) the communication between a client (like your browser) and a server (website), preventing anyone from spying or tampering (interference) with the data. SSL was the older version, but TLS is the more secure and modern version that replaced it.

To enable SSL/TLS, a website needs an **SSL/TLS certificate**, which is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This certificate proves the identity of the website and ensures secure communication.

### How it works:

* A website owner installs an SSL/TLS certificate on their web server.
    
* When a user visits a website, the browser sends a "ClientHello" message to the server.
    
* The server responds with a "ServerHello" message, including the highest supported SSL/TLS version and cipher suite (Encryption algorithm).
    
* The browser verifies the server’s SSL/TLS certificate to confirm authenticity.
    
* The browser and server use the server's public key to encrypt a session key.
    
* The server decrypts the session key with its private key.
    
* The session key is used to encrypt all communication between the browser and server.

## Common HTTP Status Codes: What Do They Mean?

When a browser requests a webpage, the server responds with an **HTTP status code**, indicating the success or failure of the request. Here are some common ones:

* **1xx: Informational**
    
    * *100 Continue:* Indicates that the initial part of the request has been received, and the client can continue with the request.
        
* **2xx: Success**
    
    * *200 OK:* The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested resource.
        
    * *201 Created:* The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
        
* **3xx: Redirection**
    
    * *301 Moved Permanently:* The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
        
    * *302 Found:* The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL.
        
* **4xx: Client Errors**
    
    * *400 Bad Request:* The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
        
    * *401 Unauthorized:* The client must authenticate itself to receive the requested response.
        
    * *403 Forbidden:* The client does not have access rights to the content.
        
    * *404 Not Found:* The server cannot find the requested resource.
        
* **5xx: Server Errors**
    
    * *500 Internal Server Error:* The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
        
    * *502 Bad Gateway:* The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.
        
    * *503 Service Unavailable:* The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.

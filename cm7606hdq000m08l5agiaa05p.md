## Introduction

JavaScript evolves rapidly, with new features being introduced in every ECMAScript (ES) version. However, older browsers do not always support these new features immediately, leading to inconsistencies in how JavaScript code runs across different environments. This is where **polyfills** come into play.

In this blog, we’ll explore:

* What polyfills are and why they are needed
    
* How JavaScript engines work and why older browsers lack support for modern features
    
* Important polyfills that every developer should know (especially for interviews)

## What is a Polyfill?

A **polyfill** is a piece of JavaScript code that **implements modern functionality in browsers that do not support it natively**. It works by detecting whether a feature is missing and then defining an equivalent custom implementation.

**Example:**

Imagine you want to use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method, introduced in **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)**. This method allows you to check if an array contains a specific element:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers.includes(3)); // true
```

This works perfectly in modern browsers. However, older browsers like **Internet Explorer (IE11)** do not support `.includes()`, which will result in an error.

To fix this, we can write a **polyfill** for `includes()`:

```javascript
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function(element) {
    return this.indexOf(element) !== -1;
  };
}
```

Now, even if a browser doesn’t support `includes()`, it can still perform the same operation, ensuring compatibility.

## How JavaScript Engines Work and Why Polyfills Are Needed

JavaScript engines, such as **Google’s V8 (Chrome, Node.js)**, **Mozilla’s SpiderMonkey (Firefox)**, and **Microsoft’s Chakra (Edge, IE)**, are responsible for executing JavaScript code.

Each engine has different levels of support for JavaScript features. When a browser encounters a new JavaScript feature that it does not recognize, it simply throws an error or ignores it, causing your code to break.

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
    
    Not all browsers understand new JavaScript features. Imagine you wrote a web feature that works perfectly on Chrome but **fails on Internet Explorer**. A polyfill **fixes this gap** and allows everyone to access the feature, regardless of their browser.
    
2. **Backward Compatibility**
    
    Think about an app that was built five years ago. It doesn’t use the latest JavaScript features, but **you still want it to work** without rewriting everything. A polyfill allows you to **add new features without breaking the old ones**.
    
3. **Smooth User Experience**
    
    Imagine clicking a button on a website, but **nothing happens** because your browser doesn’t support the required JavaScript function. Without a polyfill, some users **can’t access important features**.

## Essential Polyfills Every Developer Should Know

1. ### Polyfill for `Array.prototype.map()`
    

Creates a new array by applying a function to each element.

```javascript
// Array.map((element,index,array) => { })

if (!Array.prototype.map) {
  Array.prototype.myMap = function (userFn) {
    let temp = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      temp.push(userFn(this[i], i, this));
    }

    return temp;
  };
}
```

2. ### Polyfill for `Array.prototype.filter()`
    

Returns a new array with elements that pass a condition.

```javascript
// filter(element, index, array)

if (!Array.prototype.filter) {
  Array.prototype.myFilter = function (userFn) {
    let temp = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      if (userFn(this[i], i, this)) {
        temp.push(this[i]);
      }
    }
    return temp;
  };
}
```

3. ### Polyfill for `Array.prototype.forEach()`
    

Loops through an array and executes a function for each element.

```javascript
if (!Array.prototype.forEach) {
  Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback) {
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      callback(this[i], i, this);
    }
  };
}
```

4. ### Polyfill for `Array.prototype.reduce()`
    

Reduces an array to a single value based on a function.

```javascript
// Array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {}, initialValue)

if (!Array.prototype.reduce) {
  Array.prototype.myReduce = function (userFn, initialValue) {
    var accumulator = initialValue;
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      accumulator = accumulator ? userFn(accumulator, this[i], i, this) : this[i];
    }

    return accumulator;
  };
}
```
